      <p>ðŸ§ª This project is a backend-focused lab designed to explore and implement advanced software architecture strategies aimed at reducing coupling and increasing maintainability. It serves as a sandbox for testing clean code principles, scalable design patterns, and backend best practices in real-world inspired scenarios. The goal is to build a highly testable, modular, and resilient web server architecture that can evolve over time without becoming a monolith of technical debt. Ideal for developers who want to sharpen their backend engineering skills by applying theory to practice. ðŸ§ª</p>
